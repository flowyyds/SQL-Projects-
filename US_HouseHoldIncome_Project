select *
from USHouseholdIncome


select * from USHouseholdIncome_Statistics


----------------------先横向对比一下 两个数据是否一样
select COUNT(id)
from USHouseholdIncome

select COUNT(id)
from USHouseholdIncome_Statistics

----------------------老样子 先检查是否有duplicates
-------------------------检查dup 方法一
select id, COUNT(id) over (PARTITION by id order by id) as dup
from USHouseholdIncome
GROUP by id
having COUNT(id)>1

-------------------------检查dup 方法二
with id_dup as(
    select id, row_id, 
row_number() over (PARTITION by id order by id) as dup
from USHouseholdIncome

)
select * from id_dup
where dup >1

---------------- 类似CTE但是不太一样 
select id
from(
   select id, row_id, 
row_number() over (PARTITION by id order by id) as dup
from USHouseholdIncome
)  as rowtable
where dup >1


----------------------delete all the duplicates

delete from USHouseholdIncome
where row_id IN
(
    select row_id
    from(
    select id, row_id, 
        row_number() over (PARTITION by id order by id) as dup
        from USHouseholdIncome
    )  as rowtable
where dup >1
)

-------------------check again if no more dups
with id_dup as(
    select id, row_id, 
row_number() over (PARTITION by id order by id) as dup
from USHouseholdIncome

)
select * from id_dup
where dup >1


-------------------检查有没有拼写错误
select DISTINCT state_Name, count(state_Name)
from USHouseholdIncome
GROUP BY state_Name
order by 1


-------------------更改拼写错误 georia
UPDATE USHouseholdIncome
set state_name = 'Georgia'
where state_name = 'georia'

-------------------更改拼写错误 alabama
UPDATE USHouseholdIncome
set state_name = 'Alabama'
where state_name = 'alabama'

----------------------- 检查place 是否有dirtydata

select *
from USHouseholdIncome
where Place='' or place is null


select *
from USHouseholdIncome
where county= 'Autauga County' 
order by 1



-------------------------------更新place 列 空白值（populate values into null or blank cells ）
update USHouseholdIncome
set place = 'Autaugaville'
where county= 'Autauga County' and place ='' or place is null


----------------------检查type column
select *
from USHouseholdIncome
where Type='' or Type is null

select Type, COUNT(Type)
from USHouseholdIncome
Group BY Type 
order BY 1

update USHouseholdIncome
set Type='Borough'
where  Type = 'Boroughs'

----------------------检查aland awater column aka-有没有哪个county 只有land 或者只有water
select Aland, Awater
from USHouseholdIncome
where (Awater=0 or Awater is null or Awater ='')
and (Aland=0 or Aland is null or Aland ='')

----------------so there is no both null value in aland and awater.



----------------------------/********-----PART 2 EDA------*******/----------------------------------

--------------------- 将两个table link 起来
select * 
from USHouseholdIncome u
RIGHT Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where u.id ='' or u.id is null or u.id='0'

----------------------- select where mean is not 0
select * 
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'


------------------找到两个表格 有共性的 地方
select * 
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'

-------------------选出 高收入人群 按州分类， 选出top 10
select top 10 u.state_name,AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by u.state_name
order by 2 DESC

select top 10 u.state_name,AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by u.state_name
order by 2 DESC


-----------------------看下按居住区域 收入分类
ALTER TABLE  USHouseholdIncome_Statistics
ALTER COLUMN Mean Bigint NULL

ALTER TABLE  USHouseholdIncome_Statistics
ALTER COLUMN Median Bigint NULL

select top 10 Type,  AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by Type
order by 2 DESC

-------------------用count(Type)排序之后  Municipality从榜消失了，(因为限制了top 10)
select top 10 Type, count(Type) as type_total, AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by Type
order by 2 DESC

------------------改成 top 20  Municipality出现了
select top 20 Type, count(Type) as type_total, AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by Type
order by 2 DESC


-------------------看看那里收入最低，选出
select top 20 Type, count(Type) as type_total, AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by Type
order by 4 DESC

select * 
from USHouseholdIncome
where Type = 'Community'


--------------------- 选出 大部分居住地 饱和度高的 having count(Type)>100
select Type, count(Type) as type_total, AVG(mean) as income_mean , avg(median) as income_median
from USHouseholdIncome u
INNER Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
where mean <>'0'
group by Type
having count(Type)>100
order by 4 DESC



-------------------EDA 主要看 type level,City level，County level 等 人均家庭单位收入

-- ---------------(只看 city level 均值)
select top 10 u.state_Name, City, avg(mean) as avg_mean
from USHouseholdIncome u
Join USHouseholdIncome_Statistics us
on u.id = us.id
group by u.state_Name, City
having avg(mean)>0
order by 3 DESC

-- ---------------(只看 city level 均值和中位数)
select top 10 u.state_Name, City, avg(mean) as avg_mean, avg(median) as income_median
